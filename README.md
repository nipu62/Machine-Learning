# Machine-Learning
This repository contains some of the common machine learning algorithm implementations i.e. KNN, Linear Regression, Perceptron and ANN.

**ANN:** The program builds a simple artificial neural networks using three layer of neural network (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer) with the Backpropagation learning algorithm on a handwritten digits recognition dataset.

**KNN:** This program implements k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm for pendigits dataset from UCI datasets directory.

**Linear Regression:** This program implements linear regression with the gradient descent learning algorithm and visualizes the learning process of regression.

**Perceptron:** This program demonstrates the knowledge of Perceptron classification algorithm and visualizes the learning process of perceptron.

**NER-BERT:** This project focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the pretrained BERT model with extended feature vectors and measures the accuracy of the proposed solution.
